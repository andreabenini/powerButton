# Bill Of Materials
...a really short list for a really simple project...
- [AT Tiny 85 USB](https://www.google.com/search?q=attiny85+usb)  
    Really cheap and affordable, there's not need for something better, I've just got the cheapest
    CPU I already had around. Current cost is ~1$ for a piece, discounts for volumes are usually
    applied
- [1 channel relay module](https://www.google.com/search?q=1+channel+relay+module)  
    Usually related to arduino circuits, basically just a relay with transistor and diode already
    connected. Always cheaper than creating the same circuit on your own, 50c for a piece from
    well known far east resellers
